Different states


1.) alpha is creativity
2.) theta is the dreamy state, psychic ability. This is where ideas come from
Delta is a deeper state

To go from theta to beta Thomas Edison would hold a steel ball and take a nap. When he would drift off to sleep the hand would drop releasing the metal ball onto the iron below jolting him out of sleep and in his mind would be an idea. theta to beta.
