1.) Don't show the button until the very end. It get people more bought in and more likely to buy and take the higher offer (6 bag)

2.) On desktop show 1 bag offer on left, 6 bag in middle (say best seller) and 3 bag at end. This will increase more people taking 6 bag offer. But on mobile show the 6 bag first, 3 bag 2nd, and 1 bag next if not they will just choose the 1 bag.




instead of giving a sample

Do 3 offers on the page because your price is not that high.

one bag $29.95   3 bags 22:95  6 bags 14.95    

Or 29.95 one bag, 24.95 for 3 and 19.95 for 6 bags split test this pricing with above.

Then upsell them more. but don't show full price for 3 bags and 6 bags until the checkout page like he mentioned here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNJiGlBwDNI   use that exact checkout page. So you may need to create 3 different checkout pages so they can so it shows the one option they chose but it won't work in woofunnels so just do 3 separate ones just like im 21 did.


4.) AOV copy test smart people buy for. Customers who get the best results get the most bags. Model the salt offer how they do that and his CBD.



4.) Don't show total price on sales page just show price per bottle and on checkout page show total use the checkout page that is proven in ecom.

5.) Make guarantee clear. The less friction you have the higher it converts. Tell them if they need to return something . Model this gurantee 

 6.) Change guarantee to 180 day guarantee. Less returns, and more likely to order 6 bags.


Also you can use the refund script he talks about in video right it down 


7.) Update reviews so they are recent . Same with screenshots make it seem recent

8.) Avoid free shipping on single bottle option. Or if you offer it don't show it on the price option.

9.) Hight the taste throught out copy for a edible supplements
