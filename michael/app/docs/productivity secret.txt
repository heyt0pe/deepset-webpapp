To become more productive, just follow Ivy Lee’s advice…

1. Every evening before finishing work, write down 3 to 5 things to get done the next day.
2. Rank them from highest to lowest priority.
3. First thing in the morning, start work on the task of highest priority.
4. Only move on to task #2 when you’ve fully completed task #1.
5. Repeat.
